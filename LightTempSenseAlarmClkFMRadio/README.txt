This contains the schematics and source code of a Light and Temperature Sensing Alarm Clock and FM radio using an Atmega128 and an Atmega48

The Atmega48 sends a RS232 signal to the Atmega128 giving the remote temperature reading. This RS232 signaling can be used for a long cable

The light sensor uses a photoresistor and when the light is lower, it dims the 7 segment display of the alarm clock and FM radio

The alarm clock can be set to go off at any time using pushbuttons

The FM radio recieves an FM signal and the knobs connected to the microcontroller can be turned to change the frequency to listen to
